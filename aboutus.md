SDSU badminton is a recognized student organization at SDSU. The club is open to all San Diego State University students who are interested in playing badminton. Skill levels of all ranges are encouraged to join! We hold our badminton practices at the ARC. Optionally, we have a competitive team that competes against other university badminton clubs in California.
