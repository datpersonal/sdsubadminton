**Pros**
: This is the OG store that many badminton players from high school get their very first racket (including me) or shoes from. Needless to say, the shop is one stop shop when it come to badminton equipment.

**Cons**
: Their selection can be limited since they are not a big store and being YONEX only store. They are on the pricey side since they are small mom and pop shop. However, they have tons of discount when you have became their regular.

**Pros**
: Their shop carry a variety of brands. Their price is a little cheaper compare to digisport.

**Cons**
: They don't have a wide selection. Only those that are mainstream.

### Joy Badminton

| Telephone: | (619) 416-1162 |

**Pros**
: There is an online storefront and a physical storefront. Price is decent compare to most places down here in San Diego.

**Cons**
: Their physical storefront is in el monte which is kinda far. Unless you have business up there, I wouldn't recommend to go out your way there just to buy stuff like 10%-20% cheaper.
